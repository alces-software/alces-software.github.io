Capable of running as a single machine, or scalable to many nodes for larger workloads, users can interact with a dynamic cloud environment just like it's a local cluster. With both command-line and graphical desktop connectivity supported, you can use the cloud as your personal compute environment.</p>

A quick and easy launch method allows you to scale your environment to your budget; nodes can be manually added to the environment and automatically join the environment, or optionally - Alces tools can deploy additional compute power for you when required. With support for AWS spot, on-demand and private cloud platforms, Alces Flight provides a consistent, scalable environment for running research compute workloads.</p>
